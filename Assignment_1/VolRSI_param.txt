The Volume RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a technical indicator used to analyze the strength of volume flows in a stock or security. It measures the magnitude of recent volume changes and helps identify overbought or oversold conditions.

'volume' -> The input data used to calculate the Volume RSI is the volume data of the stock or security.
'period' -> The time period is the number of periods used to calculate the Volume RSI. It determines the 
            length of the lookback window for the RSI calculation. The default value is 14 periods.


How is RSI calculated

-> Calculate the RSI (Relative Strength Index) of the volume data using the chosen time period.
   > The RSI is calculated based on the average gains and losses in volume over the specified time period.
   > The RSI formula involves the calculation of the Relative Strength (RS), which is the ratio of the average 
     gain to the average loss over the chosen time period.
   > The RSI is then calculated as 100 - (100 / (1 + RS)).

-> The resulting RSI values represent the Volume RSI indicator.


The Volume RSI can be interpreted as follows:

-> Values above 70 indicate that the volume is overbought, suggesting a potential reversal or decrease in 
   volume.
-> Values below 30 indicate that the volume is oversold, suggesting a potential increase or reversal in volume.
-> Crosses above 70 or below 30 may be considered as potential trading signals, indicating potential buying or 
   selling opportunities.
