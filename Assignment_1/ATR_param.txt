The Average True Range (ATR) is a technical indicator used to measure volatility in a stock or security. 
It provides insights into the range of price movement over a given period.

'high': -> The input data used to calculate the ATR is the high prices of the stock or security.
'low':  -> The low prices of the stock or security are used in conjunction with the high prices to 
                  calculate the ATR.
'close' -> The close prices of the stock or security are also used in the ATR calculation.
'period'  -> The time period is the number of periods used to calculate the ATR. It determines the 
                  length of the lookback window for the ATR calculation. The default value is 14 periods.

How is Average True Range calculated?

-> Calculate the True Range (TR) for each period.
    > The True Range is the greatest of the following three values:
    > The difference between the current high and the current low.
    > The absolute value of the difference between the current high and the previous close.
    > The absolute value of the difference between the current low and the previous close.

-> Calculate the Average True Range (ATR) over the specified time period.
    > The ATR is calculated as the exponential moving average (EMA) of the True Range values over the chosen 
      time period.
    > The EMA assigns more weight to recent True Range values, giving a higher emphasis on recent volatility.

-> The resulting ATR values represent the Average True Range indicator.



The Average True Range (ATR) can be interpreted as follows:

-> Higher ATR values indicate higher volatility, suggesting larger price swings and potential trend changes.
-> Lower ATR values indicate lower volatility, suggesting smaller price swings and potential consolidation or 
   stable market conditions.
-> Traders may use ATR values to set appropriate stop-loss levels, determine position sizing, or identify 
   potential breakouts.
